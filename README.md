# LaundrySyari

Laundry sharia or call it the laundry is basically the same with other laundry services. It's just that this sharia laundry emphasizes and prioritizes not only cleanliness but more important is the sacred result of washing produced. Technically, of course, can be learned from various literature how to wash justified syar'i. For example by not mixing clothes one customer with another customer. Then separate between the underwear (if any) with the other clothes. Then rinse by using running water with a justified count according to shar'i.
